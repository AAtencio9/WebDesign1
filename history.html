<h2>How Did Football Start?</h2>
<p>American Football originates from 2 sports, rugby and soccer. Soccer was very popular at
the time with rugby growing in popularity close behind. According to <a href="https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-football" target="_blank" title="Click here to view 'History.com' article">History.com</a>, "On November 6, 1869, Players from
Princeton and Rutgers held the first intercollegiate, football contest in new Brunswick, New Jersey, playing a soccer-style game with
rules adapted from the London Football Association".</p>
<p>The man most responsible for the way football is played today, is a man called Walter Camp. He was nicknamed,
"Father of American Football". He was a Yale undergraduate and a medical student from 1876 to 1881. He played halfback and served as a team captain, which
was equivalent to the head coach at the time. He helped shape some of the rules set by the IFA (Intercollegiate Football Association).</p>
<p>Because of Camp, the IFA made two major innovations: they threw away the "scrummage" rule and made the requirement that a team
give up the ball after fiaking to move down the field a specified yardage in a certain number of "downs". Camp introduced many other innovations
like: 11-man teams, the quarterback position, the line of scrimmage, offensive signal-calling, and the 7 point scoring scale that is still in use today.
Camp coached the Yale team with a record of 67-2 from 188-1892.</p>

<h2>History of the NFL</h2>
<p>In 1920, The American Professional Football Association was founded in Canton, Ohio. This would be the beginning of the rise in popularity of this sport.
After growing in size and popularity, a small league called the "NFL" merged with another small league called the "AFL", the NFL's rival, in 1970. The American Football Association would change their name to
the National Footbal League, or the NFL. The first Super Bowl would be held on January 15, 1967, then being called the "AFL-NFL World Championship Game". It was played in Los Angeles, California, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
The First teams to play in the Super Bowl were the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs.
The Packers defeated the Chiefs, 35-10.</p>
<p>Since then, the NFL has become the most popular league for any sport in America, with millions of people watching a regular-season game. Football continues to grow in popularity
more and more every year.</p>
